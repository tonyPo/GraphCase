# GraphCase
Inductive graph auto encode for creating embeddings on weighted, directed graphs including node and edge label information. The algorithm is based on a *CA*nonical ordering of the graph neighbourhoud based on the edge weight or properties combined with either a stochastic or deterministic *S*ampling approach. The sampled neightbourbour is fed into a standard auto-*E*ncoder to create an embeding per layer. Hence the name GraphCase: *CA*nonical ordering and *Sampling *E*ncoder.  By iteration over multiple layer the scope of the resulting embedding is increased.
